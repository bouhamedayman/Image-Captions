# Image-Captions
In these project i worked on restructering the data  loading the data and modeling , and using Flicker dataset I created a model so we can do Image captioning .
I used pytorch, pytorch lightning for the modeling, PIl library , torchvision for treating the images and space for the text .

Vocabulary.py  : processing the text data and the captions

Flicker_dataset.py : processing flicker dataset (captions and images)

Datloader.py : prepare the dataloader for flicker dataset 

Model.py : built the encoder , decoder and RCNN 

essai.ipynb : some explorations of the built class and methods work and model training
